Once upon a time a brother and sister named Hansel and Gretel lived in a hut in the woods with their father, who was a poor woodcutter, and his wife their stepmother.  
The stepmother made life very hard for the two of them.  
They were not allowed to eat until after the stepmother had taken everything she wanted off the plates.  
Most of the time, there was only a crust of bread left.  
And all day long were hard chores for them to do. Hansel and Gretel tried to tell their father about this but he would not hear of it.  
It seemed the only one he would listen to was his wife.  And all the stepmother talked about was how much trouble it was to have children in the hut, and how much she wished they would go away forever. 
Each day there was less and less food for the boy and girl to eat.  
Yet the stepmother gave them more and more hard work to do. 
Each day there was less and less food for the boy and girl to eat.  And all day long were hard chores for them to do. Hansel and Gretel tried to tell their father about this but he would not hear of it.
