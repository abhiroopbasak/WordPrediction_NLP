# Word Prediction

## Using Natural Language Processing

Let us start by introducing the main files required and the libraries needed to be installed

* NLP word processing.ipynb : Model training and development; also has the reference to the training dataset and can be used to make changes to the model
* book.txt : Main dataset used to train the model
* book_clean.txt : Intermediate file used in the creation of the model
* cudart64_110.dll : Script used to run the tensorflow application
* text.txt : File used to test and model and get the output
* tokenizer.p : Script used to run the tokenizer function of the keras package
* model.h5 : Model after compiling and saving and is referenced to use it at once
